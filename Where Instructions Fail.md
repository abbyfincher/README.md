## Not Everyone Can Write

Chemistry labs. Zoology Labs. Putting together IKEA furniture. All these things have one common denominator - they do not instruct well. Where some individuals succeed in laying out what to do in a clear and concise manner, some need to practice or have others proofread to see if what they wrote makes a lick of sense. Most of the time, though, when it comes to following instructions, it is rather confusing (unless it's a recipe. How does one mess up a recipe?). Practice makes perfect...and some people need to practice just a wee bit more. 

 Good fun. Great show. Bravo. Can I take a nap now? Please?
 Coffee!!!!! 
 My roommate is scaring me! Help me! HELP! NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! 
 
 I died because you didn't save me. Now I am living as a ghost in a computer digital world thingy crap fest. But I guess eternal sleep isn't bad. Nap party! Keep yo pillow to yoself. 
 
 I am wrapped up. I'm just...having fun now. SLEEP DEPRIVATION!
