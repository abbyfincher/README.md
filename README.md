# Technical Writing Plain Text/Github Practice 
#### With a side of caffeine-induced sass...

## Current Workflow Strategy
Currently, I use Microsoft Word to write papers because I don't like GoogleDocs WHATSOEVER. I write my paper, proofread, have a friend proofread, edit, and save to mulitple places. I use 2 flashdrives and email the documents to myself on both my Google account and my school email. 
To track changes, I print the document and use a red pen (so I can see it) and mark through things that are abominaitons and don't deserve to live in the world of the printed. 

## Technical Writing Strategies
- Back Up: Well...apparently Github, Markdown, and Pandoc are good ways to save things, but I will still use flashdrives and email in order to save my content because I don't trust the Internet for saving my stuff.
- Make Portable: Flashrives and email...Literally anywhere you go and have a computer, this will work. But the Cloud is apparently portable as well and plain text lets you open files no matter what computer you're on, but PC is life so PC has Microsoft Word, so PC forever!
- Track Changes: Microsoft Word - TRACK CHANGES IS LOVELY! Proofreading, no matter what is being written, is important to convey what thouest says clearly without looking like a complete idjit. 
- Automate: I don't know what this means because we didn't really discuss it. So....Yeah...

## What Strategies Would I Use From This Class
1) We'll see. I'm very set in my ways and may or may not use what is taught in this class after I am finished with it.
2) Maybe Markdown...I don't know. It's fun to just see things in plain text, but I don't know if I'll ever use it outside of this class.
3) I will probably never use Github again. So...
4) Never...Seriously...Like...Ever To quote the Beast (kind of) *clears throat* --- NEVERMOOOOOORRREEEE!!!!!
